			Here I have the map and gameplay to represent the concept of labyrinths. More specifically, 
			I was able to relate the map and gameplay to the movie timecode. In this movie we have four 
			different camera perspectives and each person in those cameras are living their own lives. 
			The decisions that they make invdividually have the potential to effect someone else in another 
			camera perspective. Occasionally, individuals will interact with each other and both cameras would
			show both individuals. In the gameplay of league of legends, each player plays their role in the map,
			top lane, middle lane, and bottom lane as shown in the map. During the beginning of the game, decisions 
			that are made in game could have the potential of affecting other players on their team. They could be 
			affected both emotionally and physically in game. Occasionally, players will interact with each other 
			in different parts of the map and together could affect each other and other players in game.

			<p>Here we have Advance Champion Techniques to correlate with found objects. Found objects 
			are objects within, for example a piece of art, that are not meant to be art themselves yet 
			these objects are considered art. So the way I was able to correlate Advance Champion Techniques
			is that some champions enable you could use the features of the map to your advantage. Orignally, 
			the walls of the map is there to force you navigate strategically so that you can use it to your 
			advantage. However, with some champions/characters you can use certain techniques that allow you 
			to use these walls for their unintended purposes and for your advantage. Here are some video that 
			demonstrate that.
